This project is an AI-powered assistant that helps technicians  interpret elevator fault-related queries and retrieves appropriate troubleshooting guidance, reducing
manual document searching and diagnosis time. Technicians can enter a fault description or code, and the system provides a clear explanation and basic troubleshooting guidance using AI.

Elevator maintenance technicians depend on technical manuals, fault code documentation, and prior experience to diagnose and resolve system issues.This results in increased elevator downtime, 
slower fault resolution, inconsistent maintenance quality and potential safety risks due to misinterpretation of procedures
